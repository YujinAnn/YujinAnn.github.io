## Is the output small for a disturbance input?
- Suppose that our control analysis involves a requirement of disturbance attenuation.
- Let's say a disturbance input $u$, its effect on the system output $y$, and G is the impulse response from $u$ to $y$.
- How much $u$ affects $y$ according to various measures?
- This is different depending on input signal, measurement ways of the output, and it transfer function.

## System gain table
- If u is known
- We want to know the least upper bound on a norm of the output, that is:
  
  $$\sup {{||y|| : u=f(t)}} $$
