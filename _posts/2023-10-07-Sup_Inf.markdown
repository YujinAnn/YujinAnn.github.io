## (1) Supremum: least upper bound
   
- Let F be a set and \(S \subseteq F\) be nonempty. The supremum of S, if it exists, is some \(b_0 \in F\) such that 
- (1) \(b_0\) is an upper bound of S
- (2) if b is any other upper bound of S, then \(b_0 \leq b\).
- If it exists, the supremum of S is denoted sup(S).

## (2) Infimum: greatest lower bound
   
- Let F be a set and \(S \subseteq F\) be nonempty. The infimum of S, if it exists, is some \(b_0 \in F\) such that 
- (1) \(b_0\) is an lower bound of S
- (2) if b is any other lower bound of S, then \(b_0 \geq b\).
- If it exists, the infimum of S is denoted inf(S).

## Ex (1)
- If \(N \subseteq R\), sup(N) does not exiest. inf(N) = 1
- If a set \(A = {x \in Q | x^2 \l}\)
