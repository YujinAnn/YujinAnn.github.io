## (1) Supremum: least upper bound
   
- Let F be a set and $S \subseteq F$ be nonempty. The supremum of S, if it exists, is some $b_0 \in F$ such that 
- (1) $b_0$ is an upper bound of S
- (2) if b is any other upper bound of S, then $b_0 \leq b$.
- If it exists, the supremum of S is denoted sup(S).

## (2) Infimum: greatest lower bound
   
- Let F be a set and $S \subseteq F$ be nonempty. The infimum of S, if it exists, is some $b_0 \in F$ such that 
- (1) $b_0$ is an lower bound of S
- (2) if b is any other lower bound of S, then $b_0 \geq b$.
- If it exists, the infimum of S is denoted inf(S).

## Ex (1)
- If $N \subseteq R$, sup(N) does not exiest. inf(N) = 1
- If a set $A = {1/n | n \in N} = {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}$ and $A \in R$, then sup(A) = 1 and inf(A) = 0.
- If a set $A = {x \in Q | x^2 < 2}$ and $A \in R$, then $ -\sqrt{2} < x < \sqrt{2}$. However, $sup(A) \neq \sqrt{2}$ and $inf(A) \neq -\sqrt{2}$
