## Problems on compiling a project
---
- It is very inefficient to individually compile packages consisting of multiple source files.
- Each of the different files has a complex relationship with each other depending on the content of the code.
- If there are modifications to some code, all files must be recompiled.
- If each file has different compilers, assemblers, and different options, compile time gets longer.


## What is Make?
---
- A utility that enables a single command to automatically execute multiple commands or executable files.
- A Shell script considering file dependency. 
- Make reduces compile time, provides a better understanding of program dependencies, and makes it easier to management.
- Features
  - Output files automatically change when input files change.
  - If parts of source files are modified in the program group, it automatically determines which part of the program group needs to be compiled.
  - In order to regenerate the target file, it recompiles the target file using a single command.

## How to use it?
---
### Makefile

- Target can be used as `target files` that will generate or `Label`.

- it compiles only the codes that have dependency on modified files.

### Label

- The content of Target can be a label.
- It can be used in the case of no dependency.

### Macro

- A user-defined Shell variable to enable Makefile code being simply expressed.
- Data type is `string`.
- Macro is used as $(Macro). 
- Macro must be defined prior to the replacement place.
- Predefined Macros inside Make can be refer using `# make -p`.
