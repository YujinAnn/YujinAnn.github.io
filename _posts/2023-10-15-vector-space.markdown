## Vector Space
Let $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C}$. A vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{K}$ is a set of elements, and operations +, x satisfying listed below. 
In this context, the elements of V are commonly called vectors, and the elements of $\mathbb{K}$ are called scalars.
To have a vector space, the eight following axioms must be satisfied for all $u, v, w \in V$, and $a, b \in \mathbb{K}$.

- $u+v \in V; a \times v \in V$


## Normed vector space

- This system stores energy as forms of potential energy (spring) and kinetic energy (mass).
- Thus, The state vector is represented as $x = [p; \dot{p}]$
- $\dot{p} = -\frac{k}{m} p -\frac{k}{m} \dot{p} +\frac{1}{m} u $
