## How can we measure the size of certain signals of interest?
- For example, to measure the performance of a tracking system, the size of the error signal need to be measured. 
- Then, the control objective is to drive the distance between $x$ (output) and $x_d$ (desired output) to zero.
$$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \|x(t) - x_d(t)\| = 0$$
- The measurement of signals is called norm.


## Definition: Norm
- Usually, the vector Euclidean norm is used, but new norms can be computed if it satisfied the following properties.
- 
A norm on vector space V is a map $ \| \dot \|: V \rightarrow R $ satisfying

(i) $\|x\| \geq 0$ for all $x \in V$, with $\|x\|=0$ iff $x=0$
