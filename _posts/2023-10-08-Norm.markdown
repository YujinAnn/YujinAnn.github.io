## How can we measure the size of certain signals of interest?
- For example, to measure the performance of a tracking system, the size of the error signal need to be measured. 
- Then, the control objective is to drive the distance between $x$ (output) and $x_d$ (desired output) to zero.
$$\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} ||x(t) - x_d(t)|| = 0$$
- The measurement of signals is called norm.


## Definition: Norm
- Usually, the vector Euclidean norm is used, but new norms can be computed if it satisfied the following properties.
- 
A norm on vector space V is a map ||.|| : V $\rightarrow$ $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying

(i) $||x|| \geq 0$ for all $x \in V$, with $\|x\|=0$ iff $x=0$

(ii) $||\alpha x|| = |\alpha|||x||$ for all $alpha \in K, x \in V$

(iii) $||x+y|| \leq ||x|| + ||y||$ for all $x, y \in V$

## Definition: Norm for Signals
- Let's consider the mapping of signal u(t) ($-\infty, \infty$)to a scalar. ||.||:u $\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
